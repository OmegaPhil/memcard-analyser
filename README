General
=======

This project is currently an experiment to gain some binary file progression
and come up with a trivial PlayStation 1 memory card image parser and editor.

I recently managed to image my old memory cards courtesy of an imported
DexDrive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexdrive), however I found that while I
could use my Final Fantasy VIII saves on my PlayStation 2, all attempts to use
them in pcsx-rearmed on the Open Pandora (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_pandora)
failed - supposedly they were corrupt. I can create a save on the Pandora which
then works on the console, but not vice versa... so the adventure begins - I
would like to see if I can fix this.


Requirements
============

Python v3.? - not 2 in order to have more competent unicode management.


Documentation
=============

See memcard-analyser.py --help, although this is mainly an experiment so there
wont be much useful there (ping me if this matters).
